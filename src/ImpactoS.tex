\subsection{Dissemination of results}

%\indent
The results of the experiment will be amply advertised. NEXT is very visible in social media\footnote{Instagram: @the\_next\_experiment,
Twitter: @NEXT100Exp,
Facebook: @NextExperiment} and we are putting together, in collaboration with LSC, a science museum at ``Casa de los Abetos'', a refurbished building at Canfranc. In addition to science demonstrators (such as a cloud chamber), the museum will have a virtual tour through the underground lab and experiments, and will display outreach posters and films. A number of art works will also be displayed, as well as a section on the history of the science at Canfranc.

LSC and DIPC will hire jointly a person in charge of outreach and dissemination, to take care of LSC and NEXT web pages, keep the museum materials up to date and work in social media. In addition, G\'omez-Cadenas
is the science-advisor of the well known JotDown magazine, and develops an intense outreach activity which involves interviews to scientific personalities, including, recently, a Nobel Prize laureate (Kajita) and the CERN general director (Gianotti).

%\subsection{Technology transfer}
%The NEXT project has already resulted in a promising application for society, that of a TOF-PET based in liquid xenon (PETALO). Associate IKERBASQUE Professor P. Ferrario (DIPC) has been awarded an StG/ERC to develop this concept.
