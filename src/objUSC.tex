\subsection{Objectives of the \sUSC\ subproject}
\label{sec.obj.dipc}
\subsubsection*{Operation of \Next}

\indent

USC will contribute to the operation of the \Next\ detector, providing shifters, and will play a major role in the development of software tools (reconstruction software, Monte Carlo simulation). USC will also lead the calibration of the detector. 


\subsubsection*{\HDEMO\ prototype}

\indent

USC will be in charge of developing the software for \HDEMO, including reconstruction and simulation of the system. 
 



\subsubsection*{Personnel in the Working Plan}
The working plan for \sIFIC\ involves XXX FTEs (JA, Josh) and YYY Ph.D. students (Gonzalo...). The responsibilities on the project of the existing personnel are:


\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item J.A. Hernando is the software coordinator of NEXT.  
\end{itemize}

We request for this project 1 post-doc. 

The project is extremely suited for students, given the large training potential of our project, which includes detector operation, data analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and the opportunity to contribute to the construction and operation of a cutting edge HPXe, the \HDEMO\ demonstrator. In this project we apply for one FPI position.
