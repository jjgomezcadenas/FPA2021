\subsection{Objectives of the \sIFIC\ subproject}
\label{sec.obj.dipc}
\subsubsection*{Integration and operation of \Next}

\indent

IFIC contributes to the integration of \Next\ with a senior engineer (S. C\'arcel) who co-coordinates the integration of the system with J. Torrent (DIPC). In addition, IFIC is responsible for the maintenance of the \Next\ gas system. 

\indent

IFIC will contribute to the operation of the \Next\ detector, providing shifters, and will play a major role in the development of analysis tools and in the
physics analysis themselves. In particular, IFIC will lead the \bbtnu\ measurement. 


\subsubsection*{\HDEMO\ prototype}

\indent

IFIC will conduct the R\&D towards the construction of the BFD detector and will produce the pBFD prototype. 
 

\subsubsection*{Coordination of the \NHD\ integration}

IFIC will collaborate with DIPC and LSC in the definition of the \NHD\ interfaces and integration of \NHD. 



\subsubsection*{Personnel in the Working Plan}
The working plan for \sIFIC\ involves XXX FTEs (Michel, Justo, Pau, Sara...) and YYY Ph.D. students (Alberto...). The responsibilities on the project of the existing personnel are:


\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item M. Sorel and P. Novella are physics co-conveners. 
\end{itemize}

We request for this project XX post-docs. 

The project is extremely suited for students, given the large training potential of our project, which includes detector operation, data analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and the opportunity to contribute to the construction and operation of a cutting edge HPXe, the \HDEMO\ demonstrator. In this project we apply for one FPI position.
